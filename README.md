# Welcome
- **Welcome to my github, here I have a project about Hash. Specifically, some types of *hash* functions such as: Md5, Sha256, Sha512... The purpose of creating this project is because I was quite tired of application passwords. While I had no idea, I thought of using Python to code a *hash* string and a salt to store them. no matter how many times they are used, they are still different.**
